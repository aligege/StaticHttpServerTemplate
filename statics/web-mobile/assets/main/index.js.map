MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm, and returns that hash. \r\n* MD5 (Message-Digest algorithm 5) is a widely-used cryptographic hash function with a 128-bit hash value. MD5 has been employed in a wide variety of security applications, and is also commonly used to check the integrity of data. The generated hash is also non-reversable. Data cannot be retrieved from the message digest, the digest uniquely identifies the data.\r\n* MD5 was developed by Professor Ronald L. Rivest in 1994. Its 128 bit (16 byte) message digest makes it a faster implementation than SHA-1.\r\n* This script is used to process a variable length message into a fixed-length output of 128 bits using the MD5 algorithm. It is fully compatible with UTF-8 encoding. It is very useful when u want to transfer encrypted passwords over the internet. If you plan using UTF-8 encoding in your project don't forget to set the page encoding to UTF-8 (Content-Type meta tag). \r\n* This function orginally get from the WebToolkit and rewrite for using as
